## Installation

1. **Add to mod_celadon**: Place the `compact_nuclear_reactor` folder in your `mod_celadon` directory
2. **Include in main .dme**: Add the module's .dme file to your main project
3. **Compile**: Build the project with BYOND Dream Maker

## Usage

### Basic Setup
1. **Place Reactor**: Build the compact nuclear reactor in your ship's engineering
2. **Install Cooling**: Add radiators (for space) or heat exchangers (for atmos)
3. **Insert Fuel**: Add a fuel cell to the reactor
4. **Start Up**: Use the control console to start the reactor

### Fuel Types
- **LEU (Low Enriched Uranium)**: 300kW nominal, 45 minutes runtime, stable
- **HEU (High Enriched Uranium)**: 750kW nominal, 25 minutes runtime, requires good cooling
- **THOX (Thorium Oxide)**: 200kW nominal, 75 minutes runtime, long-lasting

### Cooling Options
- **Air Cooling**: Place radiators near space for passive cooling
- **Loop Cooling**: Connect heat exchangers to gas circuits for active cooling

## Configuration

The module uses `config/cnr.json` for balance settings:
- Fuel characteristics and burn rates
- Cooling capacities and efficiencies
- Safety thresholds and meltdown parameters
- UI update intervals and alert cooldowns

## Safety Features

### Automatic Safety
- **Temperature SCRAM**: Automatic shutdown at 1200K
